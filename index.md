# **About Me**

Hello! My name is Nisha. If you just stumbled across this, here’s a little bit about me:

I’m a 3rd year PhD student in [Environmental Studies](https://www.colorado.edu/envs/) at the University of Colorado Boulder. I also hold a Masters degree in [Economic Development](https://www.lusem.lu.se/study/masters-programmes/global-development-population-and-economic-change-masters-programme) from Lund University, Sweden and a Bachelors (Research) in [Economics](https://snu.edu.in/programs/bsc-research-in-economics/) from India. 

As part of my PhD, I work on something that touches everyone: **Food**. Specifically,I study how climate change and policy decisions ripple through global food systems — from government trade interventions to the everyday choices of farmers. My work spans three themes: the role of trade policy during climate shocks, how path-dependent institutions lock in agricultural practices, and how farmers adapt on the ground. Put together, I intend to explore how we can make our food systems resilient and what holds them back.

#### **2. Warming in Death Valley National Park (1990–2024)**

![Annual Average Temperature in Death Valley National Park (1990–2024)](assets/img/death_valley_temp.png)

Death Valley National Park in eastern California is famous for record heat, extreme aridity, and below-sea-level basins. Stark landscapes—salt flats, dunes, badlands, and spring-fed oases—host desert-adapted species living near thermal limits. That makes the park a clear setting to examine recent warming. As seen from the fugure above, from 1990 to 2024, annual average temperature in Death Valley rose by **~0.125 °C per year** (**~1.25 °C per decade**). Most of the warmest years occur after 2015. A simple OLS fit explains **~75%** of year-to-year variation, indicating a strong upward trend. [<a href="{{ '/assets/img/climate-coding-portfolio-assignment-2.html' | relative_url }}"

#### **3. Species Migration **

Exploring Swainsons Thrush ((Catharus ustulatus) Migration in the 2023 using Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) **

Swainson’s Thrush (scientific name Catharus ustulatus) is a small to medium-sized migratory songbird in the thrush family (Turdidae). It is known for its olive-brown back, buff-colored underparts, a distinct pale eye-ring, and a slightly spotted breast. The species is distributed widely across northern North America for breeding, and winters in Central and South America. The species includes two main subspecies groups — a coastal russet-back group and an inland olive-back group — which differ in both appearance and migration routes, reflecting their evolutionary divergence ([Audubon.org](https://www.audubon.org/field-guide/bird/swainsons-thrush))

As a classic Nearctic–Neotropical migrant, Swainson’s Thrush travels thousands of kilometers each year. Spring migration typically occurs from mid-March to early June, while fall migration spans late July to early November. Inland birds tend to follow interior routes through the central U.S. into Central America, whereas coastal populations use a more Pacific flyway. These birds rely on forested stopover habitats along their route for rest and refueling, making them particularly sensitive to habitat changes across a vast geographic range ([E-bird Status and Trends](https://science.ebird.org/en/status-and-trends/species/swathr/range-map))

Though still relatively common, Swainson’s Thrush faces growing threats from habitat loss, window strikes during nocturnal flights, and potential climate-related shifts in food availability. Because different populations use distinct migration corridors, conservation strategies must account for their migratory connectivity — protecting not just breeding grounds, but also critical stopover and wintering habitats. Recent tracking efforts, such as those using Motus stations, are helping scientists better understand these movements and support targeted conservation actions ([Humpel et al., (2020)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-62132-6))
